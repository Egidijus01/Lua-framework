# Lua-framework






## Description


I created a framework during my internship that integrates essential OpenWRT services, specifically UCI (Unified Configuration Interface), UBUS (micro bus), and UHTTPD (micro HTTP server). This framework is designed to facilitate HTTP requests, making it a valuable tool for a variety of network-related tasks.
